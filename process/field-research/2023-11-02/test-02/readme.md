# Test-02

November the 2nd 2023

This research rely on the idea of a mystery box. I've put a cardboard box in the classroom, with the small hole in it and asked my classmates to interact with it during the day. More precisely, I asked them to put SOMETHING inside when they feel like, may be a random idea, thought... basically anything that comes up to mind. 

Will be collecting results in couple of days.
