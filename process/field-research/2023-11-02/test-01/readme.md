# Test-02

November the 2nd 2023

While making this research, I wanted to collect people feelling and thoughts on different formulations of the sentences. I made two series of sentences, with the same meaning

Simple quotes:
I can see you’ve been relaxing.
Why not channel that energy into some meaningful work?

Haiku:
Time ticks, don’t just watch,
Engage in life’s grand dance,
Effort shapes your fate.

The idea was to see how people would react towards the same idea but presented differently. Feedbacks and observations below.

Simple quotes:
The question at the end is good, as it involves you directly into the process.
More violent and more efficient.
Less various and way too work centred.
Heartbreaking, beacuse true.

Haikus:
Sounds like instagram deep quotes.
Cool dreamy aspect. Like chinease cookie with future.
More stimulating, beacause more poetic.
Would be better to make it a bit more sensless.

## Insights

This made me realise that ineed a made those "poems" way too much "work" orientated and less art. It could be nice to add more of randomness in those quotes like FROG idk RAIN or something that way. Also, the words are not enough so I will be thinking on how I can integrate something more visual like shapes, drawings or something.
