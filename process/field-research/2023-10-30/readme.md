## Field Research

from 30.10.2023

The goal of this test was to see people reaction and behavior in terms of randomness in their output. I gave three different pieces of paper and asked to do different stuff with it, each time integrating a higher control degree, to decrease the randomness degree. I wanted to see what people will produce and how hard could be each of the task. The tasks for the following:

## 1. Do whatever

The first paper was blank and the person was asked to do whatever with this paper. I was expecting people to be more creative and do something more than just drawing. I was curious if they would do something very unexpected.

Yet, almost all of them kept them in the context of drawing, sketching or writing, with few exeptions where some of them would leave the paper blank or do some collage manipulations. Also, all of the participants told me that have found this particular exercice the hardest one, because the found themselves blocked and without ideas.

## 2. Draw something. Write something

For this exercice I asked people to do what is written on the paper. As I didn't specified the mediums nor the required area, I was expecting people to behave freely and use different drawing and writing medims etc. I was wondering if desprite the order, they might switch it or just do only one part of the exercice.

After compleating this exercice, people told that it was easier as it already had a particular context for the input (draw/write). Results showed that people would draw stuff and wrtite the description of the drawing. But for almost every drawing, I've started to realising that the ideas were influenced by peoples current state like hunger, or the things that we have seen earlier in the day *Bretagne*


## 3. 1.Draw something sad. 2.Write something sad.

For this one, I wanted to add even more precision, so I made a maximum space for the drawing/writing, added an order and an emotional factor. I wanted to see how people would react towards a concrete topic and how they would represent something emotional.

I was quite happy with this one as it made me realsie even more that actually, all stuff that people would produce, was influenced by external factors that they have encountered during the day. 

## Important Observarions.

So what I have mainly realisied as that with complete liberty and 0 concrete tasks, people would feel blocked and uninspired, while when they had a clear task and it had a high control degree in terms of space, mediums, mood etc they prodcued stuff with more easyness. So here I came to the idea that during a creative process, the inspiration is always there, but it needs a bit of the context. I think this feature can be the key of my AI assitant.
Also, almost all of the drawings and stories were influenced by the weather, previous daily/life expericnes etc so all those controllable factors can be a part of the assistant and used to customise/personilise contexts for generative inspirations. So it's also kind of translation of peoples' random daily encounters into something more poetic and visual.
