## 2. At what moments you feel the most at in peace? While doing what? (ex. when I'm watching trains...)

Coffee in the morning before starting the day, and getting back home

eggs morning moment and bike

Sketching, Gaming

In the train because I take a train that is not filled with people, and everyone is silent on it. But also at home with my cat.

In general when I'm in nature, it could be a walking in a park or simply looking at the sky (I love the different shadows of the meteo). But in daily routine it's more in the train, because with my headphones I can chill for the long trajet to Geneva.

When I find a seated place in the tram and I listen to my music

On the train watching a video or doing my make up or working, prepping my outfit for the next day at home, or watching Tv

## 3. How many times a day you find yourself sitting and doing nothing or doing something useless. And then realizing that you are waisting your time. (ex. scrolling insta for 2h)

Too much, dozen times I’d say

Far too much, especially at work, if I'm not in a rush :P ^^

Atleast 1-2 times

Tiktok in the evening

chilling the evening for around 2 hours on the tv, + 2 hours of daily consumption of social networks

I think like 2/3 times when I'm at school but a lot more when I'm home

Depends on what u deam useless, maybe 2-4 times a day

## 4. How often are you faced to random events in daily life? (ex. bird shat on your head)

Not so much, once a day is already a lot

Infinity! you just have to take the time to look.

Not everyday, but upto twice or thrice on some days

Not a lot of times, I think I may be an NPC.

difficult to say, maybe sometimes. I will say once a week (not only bird shits but also positive experiences)

Not really often I believe

At least 1

## 5. Had it already happen that very random events made an impact on your creativity/workflow/inspiration? If yes, plzz tell me what it was and what was the impact. (ex. a fine in the train made think about dope ass project that made you win swiss design awards)

Taking a shower or before going to bed

A scooter accident, a downpour, a glass spilling on my computer. Just thinking about the fact that nothing lasts, and telling yourself that you shouldn't spend your time looking for a great project.

Sometimes I see random shit on fyp of instagram /tik Tok that make me think about my master thesis, (like graphic choices). Sorry I don't have specific exemples.

It happens that a random song pops in my playlist and inspire me visuals or things

I can't think of an exemple right now but I feel like that's basically the way my brain works all the time
