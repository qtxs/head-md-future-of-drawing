# Prototyping

13.11.23

Today I suddenly got inspired by zippeners. I thought that zipping and unzipping was a very simple and playful interaction, reflecting the idea of openning a pencil case, which I previusly reffered as a box of ranfomness in terms of creation.

I was intented to make this prototype first: 
*I know you are against 3d at this phase, but for me it was easier to visualise than by sketching*

The point was to make a box with multiple zippeners that would serve as random inspiration generator.

I didn't do it at the end, because I got another idea (and had limited numbers of zippeners, my bad) and let my instiction guide my process and this came out:

And I got quite satissfied (even though I left my box idea) because this object is actually very mobile and playfull. It requires a very simple mouvement that can be translated into a poem as I wanted before. Each zip can refer to certain aspect of the poem (tone, typeface, color, size...) and be controlled at a wider range, depending on how opened the zippener is. Yet, im not sure it is still possible to integrate a printer inside but maybe I could integrate a small projector inside of it, so it displays the output on the closest surface like following:

But if it is way to hars to realise, there is a possibility to make something in a more geometric shape like:

This one is cool because it keeps the idea of a dice, and can be thrown after playing with zips. One of the surface would contain and hole with a printer.

But let's go back to the sphere. I made some user testing without giving any context:

So as expected, the used found quite intertating the zip game. And the when he started throwing it, I realised that is actually a very cool feature because it can be used as a game ball for multiple => collectif work or a collectif brainstorming. By throwing the ball to each other, ai can track the paths from person to person and use it as a path for the poem layout. And while passing/throwing it to each other, each user can add, adjust the input (zip/unzip) and so the end result will be always different and RANDOM YES!
