# Prototyping

13.11.23

Today I suddenly got inspired by zippeners. I thought that zipping and unzipping was a very simple and playful interaction, reflecting the idea of openning a pencil case, which I previusly reffered as a box of ranfomness in terms of creation.

I was intented to make this prototype first: 
*I know you are against 3d at this phase, but for me it was easier to visualise than by sketching*

The point was to make a box with multiple zippeners that would serve as random inspiration generator.

I didn't do it at the end, because I got another idea (and had limited numbers of zippeners, my bad) and let my instiction guide my process and this came out:

And I got quite satissfied (even though I left my box idea) because this object is actually very mobile and playfull. It requires a very simple mouvement that can be translated into a poem as I wanted before. Each zip can refer to certain aspect of the poem (tone, typeface, color, size...) and be controlled at a wider range, depending on how opened the zippener is. Yet, im not sure it is still possible to integrate a printer inside but maybe I could integrate a small projector inside of it, so it displays the output on the closest surface like following:

But if it is way to hars to realise, there is a possibility to make something in a more geometric shape like:

This one is cool because it keeps the idea of a dice, and can be thrown after playing with zips. One of the surface would contain and hole with a printer.

But let's go back to the sphere. I made some user testing without giving any context:

So as expected, the used found quite intertating the zip game. And the when he started throwing it, I realised that is actually a very cool feature because it can be used as a game ball for multiple => collectif work or a collectif brainstorming. By throwing the ball to each other, ai can track the paths from person to person and use it as a path for the poem layout. And while passing/throwing it to each other, each user can add, adjust the input (zip/unzip) and so the end result will be always different and RANDOM YES! So from that I made some concrete and more structured ideas:

    Pitch

    WHAT
    Inspiration generator 
    WHO
    Young artists strggling with inspiration
    WHERE
    Portable in school bag, so anywhere 
    HOW
    Translating daily stuff into a haiku

    My idea is to create a portable ai assitant in a form of a pencil case with an integrated printer which will translate daily stuff into a source of inspiration. 
    The case itself will contain various zip fasteners as key interaction. Each of fastener will correspond to different personal factor (sadness, boredom, fear...) as well as desired category (love, nature, spring...) and by zipping and unzipping it the printed output will vary (by its shape, tone of poem, length, color etc).
    By combining the tactile interaction of zip fasteners with the the integrated printer, the assitant encourages young artists to find inspiration in the simplicity of daily life, turning routine moments into unique works of art. 
    The ai assistant will be portable so its usage be everywhere and at any moment of the day, when the user feels the need to get some inspiration.
