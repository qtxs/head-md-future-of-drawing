# Prototyping

23.11.2023

I was making a research about types and possibilities of how I can integrate the slider into my pencil box. In my previous prototypes, the slider was on the side, and when I was intercating with it I didn't find it neither preactical, nor esthetic. So I sketched out other possibilities.

Still not quite sure about which one to chose, looking forward to make 3d prototypes. Struggle a lot with paper ones, especially with sliding parts.
Also, juste realisied that the printer is possibly quite big, so need to see if it's possible to take out its shell and make less compact so it fits into caracndache pencil box dimensions. If it's not possible, I'd poprably keep the same ratio but addapt dimensions.

Also, all of the metalic slider boxes that I've found, are not at all what I expect from my final product:

So I start doubting that it is even possible to make it entirely in metal, but need to talk to Laure about the other possibilities.
