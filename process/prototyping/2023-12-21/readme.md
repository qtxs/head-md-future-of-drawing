# Finalising

After talking with Laure, she gave me some new and very cool [references](/process/prototyping/2023-12-21/20231221_NewRefs/)

New sketches for object:

So I am starting over my 3d model from those skectes and references. It evolved into something more concrete, not a pencil case anymore but a home station/organiser with several objects.

Despite abscence of electronics that were ordered, I managed to find a therma printer at least, so I can start codeing and testinf stuff. #wip

To do during holidays:

- Finish 3D model
- Print 3D model
- Understand how thermal printer works
- Make thermal printer work
- Get lit
