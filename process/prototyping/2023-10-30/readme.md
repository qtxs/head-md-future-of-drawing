# Prototyping

This prototyping was an execrcie in class. I still tried to link it with my idea of randomness.

So here the idea was to create an assistant, where the user have to connect dots on its surface, and following what he has connected, the ai would generate a poem and print it out in life time. Yet, I wanted to keep the idea of randomness + accident so if the randomness if defines by random choices of the user, the accident part is represented by a mystery dot, which after being crossed, makes the ai behavior less predictible.

I like this idea this unpredictible output, but the general idea of just giving promts for a poem stays at chat gpt level. So I gotta think how I could use it in a more creative and original way.
