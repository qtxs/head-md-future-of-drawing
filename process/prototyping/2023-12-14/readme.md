NOT DONE YET SORRY!!!

# Test Day

The plan for today is to test to interactions with my device. Yet I am still quite confused as the main interaction is basically move around big areas. So I mainly tested the scales, intuition in terms of opening, expectations VS reality of users. 

## Morning

During morning session, I didn't give any info or guidance to users first.
I showed two objects. The small one was on the table, the big one was suspended. The scale would allow me to decide if I shoukd make it portable and use gps tracker ou bigger with an accelorometer to make it more exhibition orientated.

I tested:

1. Slider/Openner
2. Scale of device
3. The way they move the device (direction,rotation...)
4. Thoughts on the poem that is printed 

Feedbacks:

The big version was way too big and users weren't even taking it the their hands. It was too big to be portable. So = gps tracker. Yet I need to integrate a printer inside so the good descsion will to make my device in two parts: a small portable version with a gps tracker and it's fixed station with the printer inside:

1. Pencil case with small electronics that record data.
2. A home/office station with the printer. Prints out your paths once small pencilcase is connected.


## Afternoon

I changed the approach and gave info

During afternoon, we almost ran out of time but we still had a rich talk about my device.

Make the small 


1. Introduce to the topic: Portable creatif assistant that generates random inspirations based on your daily journey.  
2. Say that it's in two parts, one portable and one stays home/office class.
