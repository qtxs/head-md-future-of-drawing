After the last discussion with Laure about the shape and Pierre about the quantity and dimensions of electronics, I've taken the descision to make two separated boxes: one for electronics and one as the cover. It was also influenced by the possibilites of atelier metal as Xavier told me that machine couldn't do the fold the metal the way I wanted first. I stll have more questions to ask him, but I think it's more relevant to have a clear idea(s) of how I want it to look.
So I started sketching out possibile versions in fusion 360.

# Electronics

All the required electronics:

1. Thermal printer

2. GPS Tracker

3. Lithium battery in serie

4. Light sensor
Already in the kit

5. Accelometer

This last one was added probably too late, but it is something that will be needed for the exposition. As the main idea of my assistant is to be portable and to record daily gps, it is quite impossible to do so in the context of exhibition. So I sligtly adapted the project and though of its scenogarphy for the exhibition.
I want to attach the assistant to the ceeling so it suspends and people can come and interact with it by pushing it so it swings only in two axis. That's why I need accelometer here, it will basically replace the gps tracker. Recorded mouvements from it's mouvements will be used as the poetry layout. It also allows to make it a bit bigger, so I can actually double the carandache pencil box dimensions.

Next steps:

1. Discuss this idea with teachers (electronics, scenography, shape...)
2. Conceptualise more the poetry itself(what words, why, how)
3. Take a descision for the final shape
