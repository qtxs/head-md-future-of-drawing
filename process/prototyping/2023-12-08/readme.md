After the last discussion with Laure about the shape and Pierre about the quantity and dimensions of electronics, I've taken the descision to make two separated boxes: one for electronics and one as the cover. It was also influenced by the possibilites of atelier metal as Xavier told me that machine couldn't do the fold the metal the way I wanted first. I stll have more questions to ask him, but I think it's more relevant to have a clear idea(s) of how I want it to look.
So I started sketching out possibile versions in fusion 360.
