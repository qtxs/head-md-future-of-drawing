# Prototying

In this folder you can find the current version of my assistant, made with two parts.

Things to define:

- final final dimensions
- the small box opening system

I struggle with this two points becase I need my electronics to understand it entirely. All dimensions and sizes in my model are approximativ but very close to reality.

I could find some references for connecting my electronics together:

The entire wiring system shoulb be looking like so:

Basically in REAL life project, it should be conecting two parts by bluetooth, but for demo I will connect it by cables.
