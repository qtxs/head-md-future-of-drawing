# Prototyping

Today we had meetings with Pierre and Laure and could finally discuss about the actual possibilites. 

# Electronics

So apparantely, I overestimated the capacities of a thermal printer. As it works as a typerwring machine, it becomes impossible to display words and letters on the curved paths as I was expecting at the beginging:

It is hard to previsualise the pottential print but after a research on the thermal printer possibilites and typogrraphic compositions, I found a couple of variants that can look similar to what I expected (or even better):

So let's say problem solved. Also the printer can print images and grphics so it's a good feature to use as well.

Another problem was that GPS tracker actually needs long paths and wouldn't work from simple mouevments for example across classroom. And it becomes impossible for the demo and the expo. So either I keep gps and fake it during demo by using already recorded paths or change it to accelometer and so change sligtly my concept as well. May be I can make two different variants, one for expo and one for demo? Gotta think hard and make a descision #libra. 

# Form

So according to Laure, it's quite challangeing to make a box with a slider entirely in metal. First of all in terms of weight, it will be too heavy if I make it more than 1mm thick. The sliding part will make disturbing noises and wouldn't be so lisse. And bunch of other constraints.
But there are couple of alternative ways of doing it. The best one is to make a box inside of the box. The inside box would contain all of electronics and have "slding supports". And the outer box will be in 1mm metal sheet with a separate slider made out of metal as well. 
We also discussed about the way its should be folded/bent. I've done more paper prototypes to see which is the best way to make it. More descisions to take...

FORGOT SKETCHES SOMEWHERE. WILL ADD THEM ONCE I FIND
