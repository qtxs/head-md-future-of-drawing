# Prototyping. Work in progesss.

The departure point for those prototypes was an idea of creating a portable ai assistant that would capture mouvements, gps paths and other stuff (to define still but probs weather too) and translate them into a visual poem. I aim to create an annoying assitant that would capture the lack of mouvement and on that point it would print out a ticket saying that it's time to get shit done. The paths made by the user before he/she sits for too long, are used as paths for the printed poems.

So while making those prototypes, I tried out three variants, depending on its portability and possible interactions. I should also mention that as my goal is to translate common daily rituals/mouvements all types of interactions are not direct so I didn't find it convinient to test the interaction part on other people.

So there are my observations:

# Prototype 1

Prototype 01 was inspired by my portable iphone case. I often use it myself for writing down my random thoughts during the day etc.

## -
    As I want to integrate a small printer inside of it, it's going to be way too heavy
    Annoying object on the hand
    Not so pratical 
    Not so pretty 

## +
    Possible to integrate other sensors like body temeorature, hand lifting, haertbeat frequency

# Prototype 2

Prototype 02 was made a bit bigger so it would be more appropriate to integrate a printer inside. At this point I focused on making stuff and less thinking about it so for now I don't have much to say on this one.

## -
    Too visible
    Still not comfortable enough to wear

## +
    Possible to integate body temperature censor 
    Better than the first one (don't really know how much of a plus is that)

# Prototype 3

Prototype 03 is my favorite one. This idea was inspired by those guys:

We don't really see on the picture but you all know those fine printing machines that they have next to he belt. So this made me think that it can be actually quite fun to use this as a reference in the sens that *if you are not working/drawing for too long, you get a fine*. So I made a prototype that can be attached on waistband and is easily portable. This one turned to be my fav at the end.

## -
    can't use body temperature senser

## +
    invisible for others
    easily portable
    possible to integrate sound and overall temperature
