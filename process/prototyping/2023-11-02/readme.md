# Prototyping. Work in progesss.
02.11.2023

The departure point for those prototypes was an idea of creating a portable ai assistant that would capture mouvements, gps paths and other stuff (to define still but probs weather too) and translate them into a visual poem. I aim to create an annoying assitant that would capture the lack of mouvement and on that point it would print out a ticket saying that it's time to get shit done. The paths made by the user before he/she sits for too long, are used as paths for the printed poems.

So while making those prototypes, I tried out three variants, depending on its portability and possible interactions. I should also mention that as my goal is to translate common daily rituals/mouvements all types of interactions are not direct so I didn't find it convinient to test the interaction part on other people.

So there are my observations:

# Prototype 1

Prototype 01 was inspired by my portable iphone case. I often use it myself for writing down my random thoughts during the day etc.

## -
    As I want to integrate a small printer inside of it, it's going to be way too heavy
    Annoying object on the hand
    Not so pratical 
    Not so pretty 

## +
    Possible to integrate other sensors like body temeorature, hand lifting, haertbeat frequency

# Prototype 2

Prototype 02 was made a bit bigger so it would be more appropriate to integrate a printer inside. At this point I focused on making stuff and less thinking about it so for now I don't have much to say on this one.

## -
    Too visible
    Still not comfortable enough to wear

## +
    Possible to integate body temperature censor 
    Better than the first one (don't really know how much of a plus is that)

# Prototype 3

Prototype 03 is my favorite one. This idea was inspired by those guys:

We don't really see on the picture but you all know those fine printing machines that they have next to he belt. So this made me think that it can be actually quite fun to use this as a reference in the sens that *if you are not working/drawing for too long, you get a fine*. So I made a prototype that can be attached on waistband and is easily portable. This one turned to be my fav at the end.

## -
    can't use body temperature senser

## +
    invisible for others
    easily portable
    possible to integrate sound and overall temperature


# There is a summery of the current project state:

    WHAT
    Tool to fight procrastination
    WHO
    Young artists strggling with inspiration/motivation
    WHERE
    Portable in school bag, so anywhere 
    HOW
    Translating daily stuff into a haiku

    The goal of this assistant is to serve as an annoying reminder that its time to get some work done. By tracking the gps and mouvements of the user, it detects when this one stays immobile for too long time and prints out a haiku saying that it is time to do something. The gps path made by user will serve as a path for the poem layout. The other factors such as weather, can influence the tone of the haiku. (others to chose) So all types of the interaction are indirect. So the printed haiku is some sort of a fine for not working enought.
    The idea is to show beginner art students that common daily routine stuff can be transformed into an art piece and there is no special time to get inspiration or motivation.
    The ai assistant will be portable so its usage be everywhere and at any moment of the day, when the user feels the need to get some inspiration/motivation.
