# Prototyping. Work in progesss.

The departure point for those prototypes was an idea of creating a portable ai assistant that would capture mouvements, gps paths and other stuff (to define still but probs weather too) and translate them into a visual poem. I aim to create an annoying assitant that would capture the lack of mouvement and on that point it would print out a ticket saying that it's time to get shit done. The paths made by the user before he/she sits for too long, are used as paths for the printed poems.

So while making those prototypes, I tried out three variants, depending on its portability and possible interactions. I should also mention that as my goal is to translate common daily rituals/mouvements all types of interactions are not direct so I didn't find it convinient to test the interaction part on other people.

So there are my observations:

# Prototype 1

Prototype 01 was inspired by my portable iphone case. I often use it myself for writing down my random thoughts during the day etc.

## -
    As I want to integrate a small printer inside of it, it's going to be way too heavy
    Annoying object on the hand
    Not so pratical 
    Not so pretty 

## +
    Possible to integrate other sensors like body temeorature, hand lifting, haertbeat frequency
