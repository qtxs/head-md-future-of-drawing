# Prototyping

18.11.23

Post presentation auto-evaluation on what has to be done:

- Clarify a bit more my user journey.
- Think if it is possible to make other adjustements/interactions to make it more "playful" idk.
- Think of gestures of opening, and all gestures related to pencil box.
- Define electronics needed (more or less).

## User journey

The user journey is simple, yet not so interactive (may be I'm wrong):

1. Turning on John / he wakes up from detected mouvement
2. Putting him in a school bag / he starts recording gps data
3. Going to a location (school, uni, library, whatever) / still records data
4. Arriving to a location / stops recording gps data and analysis it
5. Opening John / triggers print
6. Reciveing the print with the poem
7. Once the entire gps path is printed out, the printing stops

I feel like its a good user journey but it's more product orientated, so gotta think about the exhibition context #WIP

## Opeing gestures

Gedstures related to a pencil case vary, we can open it or insert things inside and in multiple ways. In my case I focus more about opening it. It can be opened with zippers, sliders, unfolding...  As I need to integrate a printer inside, it should be rigid, and as my reference object is carandache pencil box, I will most likely use metal as the main material so it bedomes a bit more complex sensless to add a zippener #sad. Same with folding and other "soft" types of openings, are not much compatible with metalic surfaces, so I have a choice between a classical box (attached or not) or the slider. I feel like sliders are a bit more interessting and look prettier so I'd like to keetp this direction for now. Yet there are a lot of sliders types as I mentionned in previous steps.

## Electronics required

The mechanisms of John seems quite simple. It basically needs to be able to records gps data and print out stuff. So possible required electronics are:

1. Printer
2. GPS Tracker
3. Somerthing to trigger the print
