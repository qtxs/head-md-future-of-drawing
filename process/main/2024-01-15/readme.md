I didn't manage to make my old code workable. So I prepared a serie of [bitmaps](/process/main/2024-01-15/Bitmaps/poems//) compositions that I made, using the haikus that I generated with chat gpt. The went out pretty well but I still encountered some issues with color intensity. I guess it's just the heating issues as with each print it became darker.

Wasn't expecting that bitmaps would require so much memory, so for the demo I can only use one of them. I wanted to print a random one each time it's on, but it's to big. It was also the biggest size that I found 384x550 px and it still looks small though.

The rest of the day I spent on the final [documentation](/process/presentations/20241112_HEAD-MD1_Caran-d-Ache_Ekaterina-Bliznyuk_John.pdf) and made some nice rendredings:

I also found this [thing](/process/main/2024-01-15/2.stl) on web, to use as a clipper for my prints.
