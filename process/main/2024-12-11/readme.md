# Form

Went back to Xavier with the all the pieces. He was quite unhappy as I actually did it wrong and print supports in PLA and not carbon, they were too empty and not restant enough. But it still somehow worked #feelingblessed.

All other part of the day was working on [documentation](/process/presentations/20241112_HEAD-MD1_Caran-d-Ache_Ekaterina-Bliznyuk_John.pdf). 

Sadly tho, because I had some questions to Piere but he wasn't here.

Fun fact, any of my electronics haven't arrived yet. Hopping for tomorrow as it will infleunce a lot my demo.

Next steps:

1. Polish metal
2. Print second part
3. Improve code
4. Get that printer
