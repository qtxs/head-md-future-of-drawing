Had a metal workshop appointment todday. [This](/process/main/2024-12-10/20241210_Dimensions.pdf) was the document for Xavier.
Due to technical requirements of the bending machine, I had to sligtly change the shape of the holding metal part. Just change its radius basically.

The other thing Xavier told me is how it should be screwed correctly, so I made those additional supports that I will print ASAP and get back to Xavier on Thursday.

Then I went to Fred so he could cut all the metal sheats. Everything was done but one of the holes wasn't big enough to include the metal sheat inside, so I had to file it a bit. 
When I got home, the model was ready and it printed out very well actually. So the overall look on the moment is this guy:

Next steps:

1. Print the second/portable part
2. Polish both
3. Correct code
4. Make dat baby work
5. Documentation v1
