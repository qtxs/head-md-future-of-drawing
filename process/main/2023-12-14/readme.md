# Test Day

The plan for today is to test the interactions with my device. Yet I am still quite confused as the main interaction is basically move around big areas. So I mainly tested the scales, intuition in terms of opening, expectations VS reality of users etc.

## Morning

During morning session, I didn't give any info or guidance to users first.
I showed two objects. The small one was on the table, the big one was suspended. The scale would allow me to decide if I shoukd make it portable and use gps tracker ou bigger with an accelorometer to make it more exhibition orientated.

Theses were my plans:

I tested:

1. Slider/Openner
2. Scale of device
3. The way they move the device (direction,rotation...)
4. Thoughts on the poem that is printed

Observations/Feedbacks:

- too big
- all of the sliders are easily opened
- poetry looks mysterious but cool (make it more motivating)
- looks scary when suspended
- small version make people want to interact with
- small > big
- big "plutot un objet de bureau"

The big version was way too big and users weren't even taking it the their hands. It was too big to be portable. So = gps tracker. Yet I need to integrate a printer inside so the good descsion will be to make my device in two parts: a small portable version with a gps tracker and it's fixed station with the printer inside:

1. Pencil case with small electronics that record data.
2. A home/office station with the printer. Prints out your paths once small pencilcase is connected.

Things to define afternoon:

- how to adapt the design
- what can I improve in the concept

## Afternoon

I changed the approach and gave the entire info about my device. We had a discussion about scale and object design, taking in consideration the previous feedback and making my device in two objects.

Feedbacks:

- Make the small part the smallest I can to make it very easily portable.
- Have different output depending the general gps location (city, forest, mountain)...
- poetry language depending on the country you are travelling to.

Unfortunately we ran out time and literally talked for 5 minutes but it was still very useful. Much more than I expected.

Next steps:

- Define the smallest possible scale of the gps part (keeping carandache pencil case ratio)
- Define the shape of the printer part (maybe keep exactly the same as small)
- Define how they combine (small inserts inside, goes on top...)
- Make them 3D
- CLARIFY ALL electronics part
- Define poetry (words, meaning, tone...)
