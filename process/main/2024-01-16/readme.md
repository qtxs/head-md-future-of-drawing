I also printed out a cover for the hole that I had to make on my printer.

I also made some slight adjustements on my [code](/process/electronics/printer/Final/FinalCode/FinalCode.ino)
The final of my [fusion](/process/main/2024-01-16/Ekaterina_Bliznyuk_Final.f3d)

I had some free time afterwards, so I made [slides](/process/presentations/20241712_Slides.pdf) for the jury presenation.

So I guess this is the end. Was a cool project, thank you!

P.S. would like to know how it goes the grade goes with abscences. I know I had a lot of them but they are all suppossed to be justified (or at least 80%).
