# Finalising

16.01.2024

By today everything was 99% ready. Just needed to polish the rest of objects, put them together, make cable management, try out demo etc.

I also made some slight adjustements on my [code](/process/electronics/printer/Final/FinalCode/FinalCode.ino)

I had some free time afterwards, so I made [slides](/process/presentations/20241712_Slides.pdf) for the jury presenation.

I also printed out a cover for the hole that I had to make on my printer.
