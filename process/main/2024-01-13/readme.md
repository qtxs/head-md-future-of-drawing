 Yes I just made a huge whole on it's back. But it was the only solution I could find on the moment. I know that it may look ugly but thanks to my paper hokder on the back, it should be hidden.

Cool surprise. Any of the code that I wrote for the other printer, works on this one. The other one was also adafruit but just the previous model, so I really don't know what's the issue. It basically prints out code (wtf). So I have a choice now, either I try to find how to correct it, either I prepare bitmaps and make it a bit more graphic design looking. Have the week end to do it.
