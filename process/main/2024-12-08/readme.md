Last week. Main focus on the product making. After discussion with Laure today, had some minor adjustements on the model. Put it to print when I got home.
23H of printing, hoping that dimension are ok. All files are in this folder.

Had to reprint it like 3 times at the begining, as my printer's bed wasn't adjusted correctly enough. But I fixed the issue and am feeling proud.
