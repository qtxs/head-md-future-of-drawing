Testing out printer.
[code](/process/electronics/printer/)

 Different layots, type rotation etc. For now I just added a random number to define the printing left margin, but with gps I will map those values. Images of tests are in the folder. Goig out pretty well, need to decide which one I prefere esthetically and which works the most with gps data.

 Still need to change the font, which will be more tricky as I need to convert each character to bitmap image and associate it to the letters. Seems doable.

 Next steps:

1. Change font
2. Make list of poems to randomly compose them
3. Use gps data
4. Finish 3d model and print it at home
