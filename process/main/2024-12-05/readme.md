Customising font for thermal printer is a pain in the ass. I give up.
Concentrating on the fond of the poeme, pas la forme for now.

Came out with the idea of something enviromental/urban. Looking into stuff that surrounds it. Finding meanings, symbols, inspiration in small things around you. I found it relevant to use city related vocabulary as I am using gps data as the main input. So I requested some stuff from my homey chat gpt.

Parts of my promt:
make me 10 examples per each line of haiku.
[...]
Cool, now make it more city orientaed, focusing on the idea to inspire artists (but not too obvious), encourage them to look around them, find inspiration and create. but keep it not so so obvious

What I got:

First Line (5 syllables):

Neon lights flicker,
Sidewalks breathe stories,
Skyscrapers whisper tales,
Coffee rings on maps,
Taxi tales unfold,
Subway's rhythmic pulse,
Street corners converse,
Shadows sketch the scene,
Graffiti tells secrets,
Pedestrians paint paths,

Second Line (7 syllables):

Urban art in motion, look around.
Footsteps compose city symphonies.
City whispers, listen to the streets.
Aroma canvases, observe the brew.
Horns and heels harmonize in steps.
Underground tales, watch the commute.
Vendor stories beckon, eyes wide.
Sunsets cast shadows, explore the shapes.
Mural narratives, gaze and absorb.
Urban ballet unfolds, glance within.

Creativity sparks.
Streetscapes sketch your vision.
Cityscape dreams awake.
Coffee-stained inspirations.
Taxi trails inspire.
Subway lines draw dreams.
Sidewalk stories breathe.
Shadows birth reflections.
Graffiti's silent muse.
Pedestrian art thrives.

Then I put it in my code, first separaterly to train and understand how it works then I made arrays per each line and combined them randomly.

The 3D model is almost done, looking sharp. Need to adjust margins, and several sizes.
