 Putting the portable part to print. 14H of printing. Sounds ok. Just in case if it's not clear what I mean by portable:

 Highlights of the day:

 1. Printer arrived
 2. Printer doesn't fit in the printed part.

 Don't know what happened, nut I guess I just suck at maths. Ok. Need to think of a solution and time management as it's still 23H for the print.

 # Electronics

 Got back to code at the end of the day. Found some connection troubles and took way too long to solve it. My brain is compatible with code only in the morning.

 Next steps:
 
1. Find solution for the reprinting
2. Resolve code
3. Pick up print
