For the past week, before the Caran d'Ache [presentation](/presentations/20231116_CaranDache.pdf), I was mostly making research about box and pencil cases. As a decided that the pencil box was a very symbolical object, to represent my concept.

The one and only:

From my point of view, Caran d'Ache is very relevant reference/inspiration base object, shape, scale, material (more?less?) talking. After tuesday feedbacks from Laure, I started my research on types of pencil cases, opennings etc. There are some box references:

Yet so far, I like the last one the most, I like the idea how simple it makes in terms of overall shape and I feel like it's quite relevant for my conept of creating with small things. So I made a raw render of how it could look:

So the idea is to make a slider opener (exisiting name?). For now there is this option. Still thinking about zippeners but not really sure how i could integrate them.
