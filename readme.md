# Work in progess. Future of drawing

John is a portatif assitant, a guide for beginer students on their artistic journey. He translates their daily movements into graphic poems, using the taken paths as the graphic layout. At the moments when user feels inspired and lost, John prints out a poem that aimed to trigger inspiration. I want to make young artists understand that very simple gestures, even mouvement is already an art from. Much like their artistic path and development, its the process that counts the most, not the final output.
