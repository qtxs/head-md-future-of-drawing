I like both ideas... need to find connection between both

 Pitch

Idea 1.

    WHAT
    Inspiration generator 
    WHO
    Young artists strggling with inspiration
    WHERE
    Portable in school bag, so anywhere 
    HOW
    Translating daily stuff into a haiku

My idea is to create a portable ai assitant in a form of a pencil case with an integrated printer which will translate daily stuff into a source of inspiration. 
The case itself will contain various zip fasteners as key interaction. Each of fastener will correspond to different personal factor (sadness, boredom, fear...) as well as desired category (love, nature, spring...) and by zipping and unzipping it the printed output will vary (by its shape, tone of poem, length, color etc).
By combining the tactile interaction of zip fasteners with the the integrated printer, the assitant encourages young artists to find inspiration in the simplicity of daily life, turning routine moments into unique works of art. 
The ai assistant will be portable so its usage be everywhere and at any moment of the day, when the user feels the need to get some inspiration.

Idea 2. *has similar points,possible to combine??*

    WHAT
    Tool to fight procrastination
    WHO
    Young artists strggling with inspiration/motivation
    WHERE
    Portable in school bag, so anywhere 
    HOW
    Translating daily stuff into a haiku

The goal of this assistant is to serve as an annoying reminder that its time to get some work done. By tracking the gps and mouvements of the user, it detects when this one stays immobile for too long time and prints out a haiku saying that it is time to do something. The gps path made by user will serve as a path for the poem layout. The other factors such as weather, can influence the tone of the haiku. (others to chose) So all types of the interaction are indirect. So the printed haiku is some sort of a fine for not working enought.
The idea is to show beginner art students that common daily routine stuff can be transformed into an art piece and there is no special time to get inspiration or motivation.
The ai assistant will be portable so its usage be everywhere and at any moment of the day, when the user feels the need to get some inspiration/motivation.

A portable AI assistant that collects your daily data (gps,moving etc...) and translates it in a graphic poem. The ai itself is attached to a wrist and contains a mini printer that prints when you are not moving for longtime. The poem or more like haiku has aim to be annoying and interropting beacuse it insists on persons immobility (lazyness). Different inputs (gps, moving, hand tracker, temperature, heartbeat...) are tranalted in different viusal outputs (graphic shapes, words, type size..) for example the gps can be used as a path where the haiku will be overlaying.
