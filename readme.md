# Work in progess

##Future of drawing

November the 1st 2023.

A portable AI assistant that collects your daily data (gps,moving etc...) and translates it in a graphic poem. The ai itself is attached to a wrist and contains a mini printer that prints when you are not moving for longtime. The poem or more like haiku has aim to be annoying and interropting beacuse it insists on persons immobility (lazyness). Different inputs (gps, moving, hand tracker, temperature, heartbeat...) are tranalted in different viusal outputs (graphic shapes, words, type size..) for example the gps can be used as a path where the haiku will be overlaying.
